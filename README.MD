# binox-interactive-solver

This is an interactive solver for the game [Binox](https://krazydad.com/binox/), also known as "Tic-Tac Logic" and other variants. 

This is just the GUI portion -- [the solver can be found here](https://github.com/hilts-vaughan/binox-solver). 

There is no build tool for this -- the project is very simple and it would be overkill. You can check out `index.html` inside the `src` folder and that's all there is to it. You can find a hosted version, static version on Github pages since that's the easiest. You can't beat a static deployment without any infrastructure.
